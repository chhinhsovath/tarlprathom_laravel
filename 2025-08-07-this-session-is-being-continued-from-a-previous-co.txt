⏺ I'll continue with the task of localizing the mentoring-impact and school-comparison reports.
  Let me check these pages to ensure they are fully localized.

⏺ Now let me check the school-comparison report:

⏺ Read(resources/views/reports/school-comparison-localized.blade.php)
  ⎿  Read 463 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now let me check if there are any missing translations by examining the specific text that
  might need translation:

⏺ Search(pattern: "trans_db", path: "resources/views/reports", glob: "*-localized.blade.php",
        output_mode: "count")
  ⎿  Found 345 matches across 5 files (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let me check if the ReportController is directing to the localized views:

        "app/Http/Controllers/ReportController.php", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Good! The controller is using the localized views. Let me now check the translations seeder to
  see what translations might be missing:

⏺ Search(pattern: "School Comparison Report|Mentoring Impact Report", path: "database/seeders",
        output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The basic titles are there. Let me check for some specific translations that might be missing.
  Let me extract key phrases from both reports:

⏺ Search(pattern: "'[A-Z][^']*'", path:
        "resources/views/reports/mentoring-impact-localized.blade.php", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 211 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now let me check the ReportTranslationsSeeder to see if we have all the necessary translations
  for both reports:

⏺ I found several issues. Let me check what specific translations are missing and add them.
  First, let me search for the exact phrases being used in the chart translations:

⏺ Now let me run the seeder to apply these new translations:

⏺ Bash(php artisan db:seed --class=ReportTranslationsSeeder)
  ⎿     INFO  Seeding database.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Examine existing report controller and views                      
     ☒ Localize student-performance report
     ☒ Localize school-comparison report
     ☒ Localize mentoring-impact report
     ☒ Localize progress-tracking report
     ☒ Localize performance-calculation report
     ☒ Add Khmer translations for all report elements
     ☒ Add language switching functionality to all localized report pages
     ☒ Fix TypeError in assessment-results.blade.php
     ☒ Update ReportController to use all localized views
     ☒ Check mentoring-impact report for complete localization
     ☒ Check school-comparison report for complete localization
     ☒ Add any missing translations to seeders

⏺ Perfect! I have successfully completed the full localization of both the mentoring-impact and
  school-comparison reports. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

  Completed Tasks

  ✅ Mentoring Impact Report (/reports/mentoring-impact):
  - Fully localized with all UI elements, labels, and field names translated
  - Added language switcher component
  - Added comprehensive Khmer translations for all explanatory text
  - Localized JavaScript chart labels and tooltips

  ✅ School Comparison Report (/reports/school-comparison):
  - Fully localized with complete Khmer translation support
  - Added language switcher functionality
  - Translated all chart interpretations and data explanations
  - Localized JavaScript chart elements and interactive features

  ✅ Translation Database Updates:
  - Added 20+ new translation entries specifically for mentoring impact features
  - Added 15+ new translation entries for school comparison chart elements
  - Included translations for JavaScript chart interactions
  - Added tooltips and help text translations

  Key Features Added

  Language Support:
  - Both reports now have complete Khmer localization as default
  - English available as secondary language via language switcher
  - All JavaScript chart elements properly localized
  - Database-driven translations using trans_db() function

  Enhanced User Experience:
  - Language switcher component in header of both reports
  - Consistent navigation back to reports index
  - Localized chart tooltips and interactive elements
  - Comprehensive help text and explanations in both languages

  The reports at http://127.0.0.1:8002/reports/mentoring-impact and
  http://127.0.0.1:8002/reports/school-comparison are now fully localized and ready for use with
  complete Khmer language support.

> check again on all those reports/* have double language switch as one of the example [Image #1]

⏺ I can see from the screenshot that there are two language switchers on the student-performance
  report page - one in the top navigation bar and another one in the report header. Let me check
  and fix this issue across all the localized report pages.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Fix duplicate language switchers on all localized report pages

⏺ Search(pattern: "x-language-switcher", path: "resources/views/reports", glob:

⏺ I need to remove the duplicate language switchers from all the localized report pages. Since
  there's already a language switcher in the main navigation, I should remove the ones from the
  individual report headers.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Fix duplicate language switchers on all localized report pages

⏺ Perfect! I have successfully removed the duplicate language switchers from all 5 localized
  report pages:

  ✅ Fixed Duplicate Language Switchers

  Reports Updated:
  1. Student Performance Report (/reports/student-performance)
  2. School Comparison Report (/reports/school-comparison)
  3. Mentoring Impact Report (/reports/mentoring-impact)
  4. Progress Tracking Report (/reports/progress-tracking)
  5. Performance Calculation Report (/reports/performance-calculation)

  What was changed:
  - Removed the <x-language-switcher /> component from each report's header
  - Kept the "Back to Reports" link in each report
  - The language switcher in the main navigation bar (top of the page) remains active

  Now each report page has only one language switcher in the main navigation bar, eliminating the
   duplicate language switchers that were showing in the screenshot. Users can still switch
  between Khmer and English using the language switcher in the main navigation, and it will apply
   to all localized report pages.
