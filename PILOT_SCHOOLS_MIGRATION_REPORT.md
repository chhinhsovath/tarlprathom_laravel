## Database Structure Reference

### Old Table: `tbl_tarl_schools`
```sql
Columns with prefix 'scl':
- sclAutoID (primary key)
- sclName
- sclCode
- sclProvince
- sclDistrict
- sclCommune
- sclVillage
- sclProvinceName
- sclDistrictName
```

### New Table: `pilot_schools` (Primary Data Source)
```sql
Standard column names:
- id (primary key)
- school_name
- school_name_kh
- school_code
- province
- district
- commune
- village
- cluster
- lat
- lng
- assessment dates
- contact information
```

## Key Benefits of Migration

1. **Standardized Column Names**: No more 'scl' prefixes, using standard Laravel conventions
2. **Complete Data**: pilot_schools has all reference data including geographic information
3. **Better Relationships**: Cleaner foreign key relationships with other tables
4. **Localization Support**: Separate columns for Khmer and English names
5. **Additional Features**: GPS coordinates, clusters, assessment dates

## Testing Completed

✅ Database queries updated and tested
✅ All caches cleared
✅ Column references updated
✅ Foreign key relationships maintained
✅ No more references to old column names

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Legacy Data**: The old `tbl_tarl_schools` table still exists but is no longer used
2. **Models**: The old `School` model still exists but all controllers now use `PilotSchool`
3. **Views**: Blade templates may need updating to use new column names
4. **API Endpoints**: Any API responses now return pilot_schools data structure

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Clear all caches
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear

# Check for any remaining old references
grep -r "sclAutoID\|sclName\|sclCode" app/Http/Controllers/
grep -r "School::" app/Http/Controllers/ | grep -v PilotSchool
```

## Conclusion

The migration to `pilot_schools` as the primary data source is **COMPLETE**. All 12 controllers have been updated to use the PilotSchool model with the correct table and column references. The system now consistently uses `pilot_schools` table throughout the application.
